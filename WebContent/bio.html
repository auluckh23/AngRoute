<h1>BIO</h1><hr>
<p>Robert McDermott was intended to be the reincarnation of Robert Lowell but owing to a clerical error is actually the reincarnation of John Berryman. His poetry is quite remarkable and is easily the best on his ward. He is currently writing an opera about oranges and in his next life he wants to be a Shakespearean villain. His latest collection ‘In conversation with Kilgore Trout’ has attracted wide praise and is available in spirit everywhere.</p>
